# SML_DS5220
Implemented various Supervised Machine Learning Models on different datasets such as Linear Regression, Support Vector Methods, Decision Trees, KNN Classifiers and Regressors, Decision Trees etc.
Have built the following from scratch without susing the pre-existing libraries:
1)Gradient_Descent for ridge(can be found in Regression_Linear,Polynomial,Local.ipynb)
2)KNN Classifier (can be found in KNN-Regression_Classification)
3)SVM with Gradient Descent(can be found in SVM_GD)
